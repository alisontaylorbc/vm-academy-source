##Hello violetminded Academy attendee: you made it! 

Welcome to your new developer workflow. During our time together, we're going to be talking about source control, local development, Sass integration, and server deployment (using two different techniques).

This is your project source code, based on the Underscores.me framework. Underscores is an empty theme with prebuilt functionality, so think of this as your new boilerplate WordPress code, instead of having to reinvent the wheel. Over time, you'll likely want to develop your own boilerplate code and store it in a repository to use in your client projects, but for now, here's Underscores.

###In order to get the most out of this workshop, please make sure:

  - You have a GitHub account (doesn't need to be paid)
  - You have installed the GitHub application (works on OS X and Windows)
  - You have installed & configured either MAMP (works on OS X and Windows) or XAMPP (Windows only)
  - You have downloaded & installed either CodeKit (OS X) or Compass.app (Windows)
  
If you have any issues with setting any of this up (or you have questions), just pipe up and ask!
